# SelfDrivingCar_CNN
This is an application of [Convolution Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) which is trained to drive a car. The very first problem in having to build such a model is to have a dataset to train the model, this in itself was a very tedious task which was not so practical until recently when the games were used to collect the artificial data. This project uses one such [simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) for their **Self-Driving Car Nanodegree** (cheers to **Udacity** for opening thier simulator and the wrapper programs to set up the simulator for everyone to use).
